# CIVE 7381: Transportation Demand Forecasting and Model Estimation

I created this repo for the course CIVE 7381 while I was studying at Northeastern University. Here, you'll find resources, assignments, and mini projects related to Transportation Demand Forecasting and Model Estimation. I created a separate repository for this course's term paper. We predicted demand at electric vehicle charging stations with machine learning, using the Caltech ACN dataset. You can access that repo [here](https://www.github.com/natdave/xgboost-ev-charging). This course focuses on the methodologies and tools used to predict transportation demand and analyze travel behavior. All projects were **completed by me**, showcasing my understanding and application of the concepts learned throughout the course.

## Course Overview
CIVE 7381 focuses on methodologies and techniques for model estimation, model building, and interpreting results in transportation demand forecasting. The course covers essential topics, including trip generation, trip distribution, model choice, and route choice. Key concepts include:

- **Aggregate and Disaggregate Models**
- **Discrete Choice Models** (binary and multinomial logit models)
- **Model Building and Statistical Testing**
- **Data Aggregation and Sampling Methods**
- **Econometric Methods** (regression modeling and maximum likelihood estimation)
